# Robotics Term Project

This repo contains the source code for my term project for CPSC-65000 Robotics using [Raspberry Pi G1 Tank](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Raspberry-pi-G1-Tank) with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and [Coral USB Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator)

## [OpenCV Sample Code](./opencv)

This folder contains code that uses camera streams together with the TensorFlow Lite API with a Coral device such as the USB Accelerator or Dev Board.

## [Raspberry Pi camera module](./raspicam)

This folder contains code using the picamera library for Python to obtain camera images and perform image classification on the Edge TPU.

This code works on Raspberry Pi with the Pi Camera and Coral USB Accelerator.

## [Python quickstart](./quickstart)

This folder contains code that is based on the Python quickstart tutorial using TensorFlow Lite with Python for embedded devices based on Linux such as Raspberry Pi and Coral devices with Edge TPU.

## More Python Examples
